# flutter_api_test

A new Flutter project.

# Preconditions:
- Have Flutter extensions set up in your editor (VS Code is good)
# Installation
1. `flutter pub get`
2. Create real `.env` file based on `.env.template`
3. If you want to use real data, set `fake=false` in `todo_service.dart`
4. Start debugging using F5 once `main.dart` is open in editor
